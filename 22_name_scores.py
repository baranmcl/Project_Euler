#Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
#begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
#Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by
#its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

#For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
#which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
#So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

#What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
